"""Cosmology helper functions.

This module provides a thin wrapper around the `astropy.cosmology`
package to retrieve a cosmological model.  The function
:func:`get_cosmology` accepts either an existing
`~astropy.cosmology.FLRW` instance, the name of a built in cosmology,
or a dictionary of parameters.  It returns an appropriate cosmology
object which can then be used to convert redshifts to ages,
distances and volumes.

The default cosmology is Planck18.  Users may override this
by supplying a different cosmology to functions in this package.

Example
-------

>>> from cosmic_integration_dasein.cosmology import get_cosmology
>>> cosmo = get_cosmology()  # returns Planck18 by default
>>> cosmo.age(1.0).value  # get age of the universe at z=1

        The desired cosmology.  If ``None`` the default Planck18
