# Cosmic Integration
Cosmic Integration is a tool running on the COMPAS code that synthesizes simulated universes for stars and star systems under configurable parameters and prescriptions.

This repository (forked from the original COMPAS repo) optimizes Cosmic Integration to be more adaptable to varying system demands, and revises the source code to better adhere with industry standards and modern computer science best practices.
