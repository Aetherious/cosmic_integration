# Cosmic Integration
Cosmic Integration is a post-processing package for analyzing COMPAS-synthesized datasets using several user configurable parameters. COMPAS Repository: https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS

This repository project aims to revise and optimize the original Cosmic Integration script, ultimately transforming it into a deliverable and publicly-accessible Python package.

## Project Goals:
- Format
    - Rewrite code to adhere with PEP formatting guidelines.
    - Provide NumPy-style docstrings for all modules, classes, methods, and functions.
- Refactor
    - Split and refactor CosmicIntegration.py script into multiple modules to increase readability and maintainability of codebase.
- Optimize   
    - Rewrite code to adhere with computer science best practices and increase overall performance.
- Upgrade
    - Add parallelization to allow for processing of binary black hole datasets.
    - Add file saving for calculations to prevent dataset reprocessing when modifying plots or other post-processed data.
        - Ultimately prevents processed data from being thrown out each time.
