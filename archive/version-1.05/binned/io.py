"""HDF5 input/output helpers for detection matrices.

This module defines utility functions to save and load nested Python
data structures to and from HDF5 files using the `h5py` library.
Because the detection matrix and associated metadata are hierarchical,
we recursively traverse dictionaries and encode NumPy arrays and
scalars appropriately.  The stub below defines function signatures
without performing any actual I/O.

Functions
---------
recursively_load_dict_contents_from_group(h5file, group)
    Load a nested dictionary from an HDF5 group.
recursively_save_dict_contents_to_group(h5file, group, dic)
    Save a nested dictionary into an HDF5 group.
