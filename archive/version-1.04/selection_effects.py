"""Detection probability and SNR interpolation utilities.

This module encapsulates the calculation of detection probabilities for
compact binary mergers given their component masses, redshift and
luminosity distance.  The design follows that of Gaebel et al. (2018)
but has been modernised for readability and extensibility.  An
interpolator class is provided to evaluate signal–to–noise ratios
from precomputed grids stored in HDF5 files.

In production code the module would load the SNR grid lazily and cache
the resulting interpolator.  For the stub we define the interface only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m1, m2:
        Arrays of primary and secondary masses in the source frame (solar masses).
    redshift:
        Redshift of the source.
    distance:
        Luminosity distance to the source (in Mpc).
    snr_threshold:
        Threshold signal–to–noise ratio for detection.
    sensitivity:
        Identifier of the detector sensitivity curve to use (e.g. ``"design"``,
        ``"O1"`` or ``"O3"``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    hdf5_path:
        Path to the HDF5 file containing the mass grid and SNR values.
    noise_spectrum:
        Name of the noise spectrum group within the HDF5 file.
    mode:
        Interpolation mode.  Valid options are ``"scipy"`` (use
        `scipy.interpolate.RectBivariateSpline`) and ``"custom"`` (use a
        weighted average of nearest grid points).

    Notes
    -----
    In a full implementation this class would load the mass axis and SNR
    grid from disk during initialisation and expose a ``__call__`` method
    accepting arrays of component masses.  The stub defines the public
    API without performing any computation.
