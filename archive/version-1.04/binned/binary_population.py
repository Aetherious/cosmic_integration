"""Binary population representation for the binned cosmic integrator.

This module defines a :class:`BinaryPopulation` class that wraps the
component masses, delay times, metallicities and other metadata of
double compact object populations.  Instances are typically created
from a COMPAS HDF5 file via the :meth:`from_compas_h5` class method.
The class stores the minimal information required by the binned
integrator and provides basic helper methods for derived quantities.

The stub implementation below defines the public API without any
internal logic.  See the original ``binary_population.py`` for a
complete reference.
