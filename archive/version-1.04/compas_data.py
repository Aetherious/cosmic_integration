"""Data access and masking for COMPAS population synthesis results.

This module defines a :class:`CompasData` class that encapsulates the
various datasets required by the cosmic integration pipeline.  The class
provides methods to load information from an HDF5 file produced by
COMPAS, construct masks for different classes of double compact objects
(DCOs), compute delay times and metallicity grids, and recalculate the
total mass evolved under different initial mass function assumptions.

The design emphasises lazy loading and clear separation of concerns:

* File system interactions and HDF5 handling are hidden behind the
  :meth:`load_data` method.
* Mask construction is performed via :meth:`set_dco_mask`.
* Computation of auxiliary quantities such as delay times and metallicity
  grids is delegated to specific methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path:
        Path to the COMPAS HDF5 file.
    m_lower:
        Lower bound for the primary mass distribution (in solar masses).
    m_upper:
        Upper bound for the primary mass distribution (in solar masses).
    m2_min:
        Lower bound for the secondary mass distribution (in solar masses).
    binary_fraction:
        Fraction of stars forming in binary systems.

    The mass limits and binary fraction are not read from the HDF5 file

        This method opens the HDF5 file specified by :attr:`path` and

        A population synthesis dataset contains many systems with diverse

        are applied.  This method computes and stores these masks on the

        dependent but generally mirror the COMPAS output fields.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dco_types:
            A sequence of type identifiers specifying which classes of
            systems to include.  Valid values include ``"BBH"``, ``"BHNS"``
            and ``"BNS"``.
        within_hubble_time:
            If ``True``, only include systems that merge within a Hubble
            time.
        pessimistic:
            If ``True``, apply the pessimistic common envelope (CE)
            prescription, excluding systems flagged as optimistic CE in
            the COMPAS file.
        forbid_immediate_rlof:
            If ``True``, exclude systems that exhibit Roche–lobe overflow
            immediately after common envelope.
